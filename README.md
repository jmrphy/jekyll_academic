A Jekyll theme for academics. Based on "Feeling Responsive," I've paired this down to look and function like a contemporary academic's personal site, and I'm adding some bells and whistles for academics. In particular:

- [x] Category and tag links in sidebar
- [x] Category and tag pages
- [x] Links to category and tag(s) at bottom of blog posts
- [x] "Cite this post:" with automatic/dynamic citation information for each post. Took this from [Matthew Lincoln](http://matthewlincoln.net/). Default is APSA style but this can be changed in /includes/citation.html
- [x] Jekyll Scholar for citations within blog posts
- [x] Greycite plugin by mmadsen for downloading citations for blog posts
- [x] Meta data 
	- [x] added site keywords for SEO
	- [x] added Google Scholar metadata so GS indexes & counts citations for blog posts
	- [x] DublinCore
	- [x] COinS
- [x] Data files for Research, Teaching, and Side Projects pages
